# Web-Scraping-with-R
In this, I have scrape some information about Prices and names of items on amazon and then analyze the data.
I have used rvest and dplyr library for this task.
Get the Data from the Amazon website and store it in a CSV file. 
After that, I have analyzed it. So, that we can find the average price of the laptops of both companies.
